# Web_snake
The project is part of VAVJS curriculum. In this work, the mechanism of the game Snake was taken and used to create a web version of it. Here are available different new features, especially multiple users, following a particular user, ranking, music, etc.

The game mechanism was not modified from the original version, but it is now displayed using Canvas instead of HTML tables. The game's logic is now located on the server-side. Http server runs on port 8080 and WebSocket server runs on port 8082. The website allows multiple users to play a game at the same time using sessions. The option of registering a new user is added.

All additional information is in Wiki.
